# Problem Set Up

The basic component of a RL set up will be *Actor* (player/model), *Environment* (game/real environment/other agent), *reward function* (pseudo rule/score).

To formalize a RL problem, we can use Markove Decision Process, defined by: $$(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathbb{P}, \gamma)$$
